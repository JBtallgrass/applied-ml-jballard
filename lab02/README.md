## Overview
This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features such as age, class, gender, and ticket fare. It utilizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to classify survival outcomes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run data preprocessing:
   ```sh
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```sh
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Configuration
